Overview
Microsoft has made the strategic decision to establish a new film studio and is seeking deeper insights into the most successful film genres at the box office. This initiative involves employing descriptive statistical analysis on datasets collected from the IMDb website to understand the combinations of genres that excel in various key areas. The analysis encompasses four distinct datasets, examining the genres that performed exceptionally well in terms of domestic gross sales, foreign gross sales, average ratings, number of votes, and production budgets relative to domestic and worldwide gross earnings. The findings highlight that the combination of Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi consistently emerged as the top performer across the categories of Domestic Sales, Foreign Sales, and number of votes. Adventure played a pivotal role in the majority of the top 20 combinations across these three categories. Based on this analysis, the recommendation for Microsoft's movie production would be to focus on the Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi genre, given its prevalence and success in the dataset. It's noteworthy that after data cleaning, there were 322 unique genre combinations considered. Additionally, Adventure and Action paired with either Animation or Fantasy proved to be successful combinations, making them a secondary recommendation for consideration. The combination of Adventure, Animation, and Comedy also demonstrated favorable performance in both Domestic and Foreign Sales, standing as a third recommendation. The analysis underscores Adventure as a robust genre, consistently associated with popular and successful films.

Business Problem
Microsoft aims to create profitable movies and is keen on identifying the most successful genres.

The objective was to determine the financially lucrative genres. Additionally, the average rating and number of votes were examined for each genre, providing insights into the correlation between popularity and financial success.
